This project has created to submit assignment for Data Science project where we will be using all concepts of Data Analytics.

I have chosen Diabetics Prediction where I'll be accessing all the data shared within CSV to predict whether patient has diabetis or not.

There are 3 python file as follows:
1. Diabetes.ipynb - This python file will give insight around data loading, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, data modeling, tunning model
2. Relational Database, API or web scraping.ipynb - This python file will give insight how we can run sql query, how engine can help us to convert range of data to be a part of different table through tosql function and also can create multiple tables with this. API calling, how we can make get call to any open api and can convert the dataset into Dataframe and fetch some useful info.
3. Regex To Extract Pattern In Data.ipynb - How we can extract any useful insight from any unstrucured data for further processing. like if you have to fetch all mail id's from any large set of data that we can achieve through regex, or any mobile number something like that.
